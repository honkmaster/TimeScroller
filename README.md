TimeScroller
============

A UI Element that hovers beside the scroll bar of a UITableView (Mimicking the Path app).
This is work in progress. 

Thanks

Andrew Roy Carter for his [ACTimeScroller](https://github.com/andrewroycarter/TimeScroller), which is (at the moment) no longer in active development and thus lead to this implementation.
